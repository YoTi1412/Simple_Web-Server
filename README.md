# Simple Java Web Server

This is a simple implementation of a Java-based web server that handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content. 
The server listens on port 8080 for incoming connections and responds to different routes with predefined content.

## Getting Started

To run this web server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `Main.java` file.
3. Compile the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler.
4. Run the compiled Java file to start the server.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

By default, the server will start listening on port 8080.

## Customization Opportunities
Customizing the web server involves extending its functionality beyond the basic responses it currently provides. 
Here are some ways you can further customize the server:

+ Dynamic Content Generation: Instead of just serving static content, you can create dynamic responses based on incoming requests. For instance, generating HTML content based on data from a database or system state.
+ Additional Routes and Handling: Expand the server's functionality by adding new routes and defining how the server should respond to those routes. Each route could trigger a different action or serve different content.
+ Request Parsing and Handling: Enhance the server to parse more aspects of the incoming requests, such as query parameters, request headers, and request bodies for POST requests.
+ Error Handling: Implement error pages or responses for specific HTTP error codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) to provide better feedback to clients.
+ File Handling and MIME Types: Extend the server to handle different file types, MIME types, and content encodings.
